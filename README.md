# tipCalculator
This is a calculator for calculate subtotal and tips for orders for one or more items.

It is made with vanilla javascript and bootstrap for styles.

The database comes from a json file with all the information items as name, price, category and id.

Using fetch we get the data and manipulate it to display it into the html.
